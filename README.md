## Integration

It doesn't matter if it's hosted via a bundled javascript environment or plain javascript.

### Integration via npm

To install the package run:

```bash
npm install --save @zauberware/hermine-chat
```

Setup the Chat component by doing this:

```javascript
import HermineChat from '@zauberware/hermine-chat'
HermineChat({
    accountId: '<your-account-id>',
    agentSlug: '<your-agent-slug>',
    // your settings going in here
})
```

### Integration via CDN

Add import script tag. To use a specific version number just add the following snippet:

```html
<script type="module" src="https://cdn.zauberware.com/hermine-chat/versions/v<VERION_NUMBER>/esm/index.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

If you always want to fetch the most recent version load the data via the following snippet, but be aware that there might be some breaking changes.

```html
<script type="module" src="https://cdn.zauberware.com/hermine-chat/current/esm/index.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

Setup the Chat component by doing this:

```javascript
window.HermineChat({
    accountId: '<your-account-id>',
    agentSlug: '<your-agent-slug>',
    // your settings going in here
})
```

If you put this in your html template file, do not forget to put it inside `<script type="module">`-tags.

## Development

To contribute in the development in this application you need something like a container application.
For example you could use [this](https://github.com/ChrKahl/hermine-chat-container) sveltekit application.
After you cloned the package, make sure to add this package in the container application with your relative path. 
For example:

```bash
npm uninstall @zauberware/hermine-chat
npm i ../../hermine-chat
```

When making changes on the project you need to rebuild it. This will work with executing the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Some times the container app shows a 500 error message. If those appear, just restart it with `npm run dev`
